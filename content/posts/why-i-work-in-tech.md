<!--
- We've inherited a unique period of history where the world *grew* rather than stagnated
- The world isn't predetermined to always continue growing, it's something that depends on us individually and more broadly as a society
- Software has been one of the biggest engines of growth and development since the 70s, much more than other industries
_ I believe this is partly because, paraphrasing Thiel, the world of atoms has become harder to work in (e.g. more veto players in city planning. Would Moses work in NYC today with all the bureaucracy?)
- I believe that software is a critical *enabler* to not only its but also other industries' growth (e.g. mRNA vaccines) -->

I didn't follow the typical path of a software engineer. Down the spiral staircase to the lower ground floor of the LSE library I'd see my friends practicing for consultancies or investment banks — no Leetcode in sight.

Contrary to the LSE tradition, I quickly decided to work in software. It's been my only industry since graduating, and I'm the outlier.

It wasn't just unlikely because of my university: I barely knew anyone in this industry. I grew up in Peru, whose closest link to software is the copper it exports that's used in the electrical wiring of computers.

What I did know is that it was *exciting*. From my small window through *The Economist* and *Foreign Affairs* it felt like software was remaking industries.

Beyond that youthful enthusiasm, I've increasingly become more convinced that one of the biggest bottlnecks is our ability to write and deploy useful software, and I want to explain why from a historical perspective.[^1]

## Nasty, brutish and short: life until recently

> No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.
>
> Thomas Hobbes, *Leviathan*

Hobbes warned of life in the "state of nature" — without government and civil society — as "nasty, brutish, and short". The irony is that compared to today, for kings and serfs alike any other time in human history was "nasty, brutish, and short".

Steven Landsburg summarized the economic history as:

> Modern humans first emerged about 100,000 years ago. **For the next 99,800 years or so, nothing happened**. Well, not quite nothing. There were wars, political intrigue, the invention of agriculture — but none of that stuff had much effect on the quality of people's lives. Almost everyone lived on the modern equivalent of $400 to $600 a year, just above subsistance level... Then — just a couple of hundred years ago — people started getting richer. And richer and richer still.

That is why Robert J. Gordon writes in his seminal *Rise and Fall of American Growth* that:

> The most fundamental question of modern economic history is why after two millennia of no growth at all in per capita real output from Roman times to 1750, economic growth moved out of its hibernation and began to wake up.

This is global GDP — the value of goods and services — from the Roman Empire to today.

If you look at global from the Roman Empire until 1700 it only grew by ≈250%:

Whereas between 1700 and 2023 it grew 19,000%:

Rural Texas in the 1920s — just *100 years ago* in the country with the highest GDP per capita at the time — had:
> 'No radio; no movies; limited reading — little diversion between the hard day just past and the hard day just ahead. “Living was just drudgery then,” says Carroll Smith of Blanco. “Living — just living — was a problem. No lights. No plumbing. Nothing. Just living on the edge of starvation. That was farm life for us. God, city people think there was something fine about it. If they only knew …' — [The Path to Power](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Years-Lyndon-Johnson-Path-Power/dp/0679729453)

This isn't to say that there wasn't wealth, but that *creating* wealth by increasing the goods and services of a society was extremely difficult. The limited opportunities to grow one's wealth as individuals and groups likely led to life being closer to a zero-sum game than it is today — and thus more violent, [as Steven Pinker argues in *The Better Angels of Our Nature*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/B005SG4FI4/). Why run live a life of subsistance farming when you can conquer your neighbor and gain their wealth?

## What's the meaning of what happened?

There's a few arguments I'm acquaintanced with that might attempt to explain *why* human society became rich. Deidre McCloskey argues that the driver was [a change in ideas](https://deirdremccloskey.org/docs/pdf/McCloskey_IdeasEnrichedTheWorld.pdf). Thomas Kuhn might've said that we needed time to develop a critical mass of scientific infrastructure to [enable normal science and paradigm shifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions). Robert Gordon would just stress that [we lived through a special century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_American_Growth) due to a cluster of great inventions and we shouldn't expect such high growth to happen in the 21st century.

I want to, rather, focus on the lessons I've taken from the last few centuries of growth.

### 1. Growth isn't predestined

Part of why growth barely budged from the Romans to 1700 can be explained by the demise of both the Greeks and (to a lesser extent) the Romans, Kyle Harper

### 2. Growth is non-linear non-linear

1920 to 1970 was a particularly strong period of economic and productivity growth for the US, as Gordon has written about in detail.

### 2. Growth isn't inexorably bound to happen: stagnation or reversal is always a risk

### 3. Technological waves take decades to improve society

## What happened?

Regardless of the underlying cause — be it [a change in ideas](https://deirdremccloskey.org/docs/pdf/McCloskey_IdeasEnrichedTheWorld.pdf),  or capital accumulation

Economics talks about economic development through capital accumulation: investing in physical or human capital increases productivity, which increases growth.
Something happened from 1750. Deirdre McCloskey argues that ideas enriched the world

- Life expectancy grew by 60%, from 45 to 72, between 1870 and 1970

# For later

Inversely, there's many examples of how GDP growth concerns politicians today:

- Xi Jingping [signalled in his New Years message](https://www.ft.com/content/f3f4327d-7733-4e84-b88d-9fa34ac8e163) that growth is China's "top priority" after it grew 4.8% rather than the projected 5.0%
- Europe is also concerned about its growth — just look at the [Draghi report](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/strengthening-european-competitiveness/eu-competitiveness-looking-ahead_en) — given the widening [GDP gap between the EU and the US' GDP](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2023/09/04/the-gdp-gap-between-europe-and-the-united-states-is-now-80_6123491_23.html)
- Britain's Prime Minister [promising to "rebuild Britain"](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clll8d2vd8yo) by boosting economic growth

I get them, they're very, very important concerns! But they're also, relatively speaking, recent ones because the world didn't really grow until 200 years ago.

[^1]: Having said that, I also recognize the importance of investing in the basics like Sam Bowman [argues for Britain](https://www.sambowman.co/p/britain-is-a-developing-country)
