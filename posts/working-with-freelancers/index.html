Nothing more, nothing less. You need to be as specific as possible — to the pixel. The more ambiguity, the more margin of error, and the more errors. This can result in freelance projects ending up as a waste of time, energy and money.\nBeing specific requires explaining in detail what you’re looking for. This is an exercise in communication: using examples, providing evidence, being specific but succinct. This is an example of how I gave feedback to freelancers I was working with to build Soraya, an online supermarket that I helped build since the start of the pandemic (link to Coda page).\nOnly work with freelancers with top ratings Using a marketplace like Fiverr or Upwork is a bit like trying to find water in the desert — it ain’t easy. Even if you stick with professionals with top ratings it’s hard to find someone good, but it’ll maximize your chances of doing so.\nOnboard a freelancer according to the complexity of their work Someone doing data entry will need a different onboarding than a product designer working on revamping the site. One of the key differences is how much extraneous information you will provide. People doing data entry might not need a detailed explanation of your business, while it may be a good idea to provide the designer with the strategic thinking of your company so that he can make proposals that align with that.\nBe rigurous because your incentives are misaligned Their interests are to invest as little time as possible as long as the project is accepted.
