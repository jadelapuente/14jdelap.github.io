An iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator… Are you getting it?”\nThe iPhone — and all succeeding smartphones — collapsed all devices into 1.

He described voice as:\nInmaterial: it doesn’t take space, unlike pixels on a screen Freeing up the senses: you don’t need to use multiple senses simultaneously (unlike sight and gesture with graphical interfaces) Accessible: it’s an interface almost everyone case use because you just need to speak Emotive: voice has intonation, which conveys information about the meaning of our words Personality: we all speak in a unique way This is much more expressive, intuitive, and personal than gestures on a smartphone screen, and a key reason for why I think the natural interface for AI agents is voice.\nReinventing hardware around voice The above leads to my main predictions for the next 10 years:\nVoice powered by AI agents will be the dominant new interface of the next decade This will create a long-tail of hardware around voice While we’re not exactly there, better computation — leading to faster and more accurate LLM results — should enable this.

Our phones are essential but invasive: we can’t imagine not having it, but its interruptions and distractions have few limits. Something like a screen-less smartwatch that can still do the essentials like access our calendar, call our Uber, or make a call, can be a full replacement to smartphones for many people — especially those sensitive to smartphone’s invasiveness.\nTo extend this further, I think we’ll see the reverse trend from the smartphone: instead of collapsing all devices into one, we’ll see an explosion of a long-tail of AI-powered devices. With an internet connection to make calls to an LLM, and maybe some additional hardware like cameras to understand the user’s environment, you can make devices more helpful. Imagine a mining hat with a camera that helps you understand the geological conditions around you and security cameras that help show the type of recorded footage you’re looking for.\nJust like vertical SaaS helps you deliver more value to customers with more tailored products, “vertical” AI-powered hardware should provide more consumer value for specific use cases than generic alternatives.\n",
